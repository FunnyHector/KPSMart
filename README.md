The Kelburn Postal Service (KPS) handles a large volume of domestic and international mail. KPS cooperates with a range of transport firms (sea-based, air-based, and landbased) to carry mail to their destinations, and charges customers for this service based on the weight, volume, origin, destination, and priority of the mail being sent.

All mail that goes through KPS originates in New Zealand, and may be delivered either domestically within New Zealand or internationally to an overseas sea/air port where it is then handled by a local mail service partner. The internal workings of the foreign mail services when delivering their own local mail are beyond the scope of this project. Customers can post mail through KPS at various sites around New Zealand. For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that mail is transferred from an actual mailbox to a local distribution centre (and vice-versa) for free and instantaneously. There are seven such distribution centres in New Zealand: Auckland, Hamilton, Rotorua, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin.

Mail originating in New Zealand can be sent from one distribution centre to another, or it can be sent internationally to a sea/air port of another country. For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that all mail to a country goes to the same port. Mail destined for an international sea/air port may need to go through other countries sea/air ports, depending on the routes that transport firms are currently offering.

Customers can specify a priority for their mail. The higher the priority, the more expensive it is for the customer. International air priority requires the mail to be transferred by air. International standard priority requires that the mail be transferred by land or sea (unless air transfer is the only option). Domestic air priority and domestic standard priority are the same.

The price customers are charged is based on priority, volume, weight, and destination. All New Zealand domestic destinations are considered the same for the purposes of charging the customer.
